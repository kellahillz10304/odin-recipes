    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ceasar salad's creation is generally attributed to the restaurateur Caesar Cardini, 
        an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.  
        His daughter Rosa recounted that her father invented the salad at his restaurant Caesar's 
        (at the Hotel Caesar in Tijuana, Mexico) when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. 
        Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing "by the chef."
        Cardini was living in San Diego, but he was also working in Tijuana, where he avoided the restrictions of Prohibition.
        A number of Cardini's staff have said that they invented the dish.</p>
