    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The most basic of all no-knead loaves, this is a wonderful<br>
       way to get into yeast-bread baking. The easy stir-together<br> 
       dough rests in your refrigerator, developing flavor all the time,<br> 
       till you're ready to bake. About 90 minutes before you want to serve bread,<br> 
       grab a handful of dough, shape it, let it rise, then bake for 30 minutes.<br> 
       The result? Incredible, crusty artisan-style bread, worthy of its 2016 Recipe of the Year title.</p>
